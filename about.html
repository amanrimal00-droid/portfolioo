  <p class="about-text">I’m Aman Rimal, a passionate Creative Graphic Designer and Visual Storyteller. Over the past 2+ years, I’ve helped brands, creators, and businesses bring their ideas to life through visually compelling designs, social media content, and cinematic video edits.

My work is all about telling stories visually  whether it’s crafting a memorable brand identity, designing engaging Instagram posts, or producing captivating video content. I focus on creating designs that not only look amazing but also connect with the audience on a deeper level.

As a freelancer, I’ve collaborated with a diverse range of clients, from startups to established brands, and I enjoy turning concepts into polished, professional visuals that make an impact. My expertise spans:

Graphic Design: Logos, posters, social media campaigns

Video Editing: Reels, YouTube edits, promotional videos

Branding & Visual Identity: Complete brand systems and storytelling

Content Creation: Creative digital assets for social platforms

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and strategy, and I’m constantly exploring new tools, techniques, and visual trends to deliver top-quality work. My goal is to help brands and creators communicate their story through striking, professional, and meaningful visuals.</p>
